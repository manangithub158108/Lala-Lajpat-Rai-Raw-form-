        <h1> Lala Lajpat Rai's Patriotism towards India :-</h1>
        <p>
            After joining the Indian National Congress and taking part in political agitation in Punjab, 
            Lala Lajpat Rai was deported to Mandalay, Bud that there was insufficient evidence to hold him 
            for subversion. Lajpat Rai's supporters attempted to secure his election to the presidency of the 
            party session at Surat in December 1907, but he did not succeed.

            Graduates of the National College, which he founded inside the Bradlaugh Hall at Lahore as an 
            alternative to British institutions, included Bhagat Singh.[11] He was elected President of the 
            Indian National Congress in the Calcutta Special Session of 1920. In 1921, he founded 
            Servants of the People Society, a non-profit welfare organisation, in Lahore, which shifted its 
            base to Delhi after partition, and has branches in many parts of India. According to him, 
            Hindu society needs to fight its own battle with caste system, position of women and 
            untouchability.Vedas were an important part of Hindu religion but the lower caste were not 
            allowed to read them. Lala Lajpat Rai approved that the lower caste should be allowed to read 
            them and recite the mantras. He believed that everyone should be allowed to read and learn from 
            the Vedas.

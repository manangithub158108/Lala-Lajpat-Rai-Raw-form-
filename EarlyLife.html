        <h1> Lala Lajpat Rai's Early life :-</h1>
        <p>
            Lajpat Rai was born on 28 January 1865 in a Punjabi Hindu family, 
            as a son of Urdu and Persian government School teacher Munshi Radha Krishan and his wife 
            Gulab Devi, in Dhudike.

            In the late 1870s, his father was transferred to Rewari, where he had his initial education in 
            Government Higher Secondary School, Rewari, Punjab province , where his father was posted as an 
            Urdu teacher. During his early life, Rai's liberal views and belief in Hinduism were shaped by 
            his father and deeply religious mother respectively, which he successfully applied to create a 
            career of reforming the religion and Indian policy through politics and journalistic writing. 
            In 1880, Lajpat Rai joined Government College at Lahore to study Law, where he came in contact 
            with patriots and future freedom fighters, such as Lala Hans Raj and Pandit Guru Dutt. While 
            studying at Lahore he was influenced by the Hindu reformist movement of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, 
            became a member of existing Arya Samaj Lahore (founded 1877) and founder editor of Lahore-based 
            Arya Gazette. When studying law, he became a firm believer in the idea that Hinduism, above 
            nationality, was the pivotal point upon which an Indian lifestyle must be based. He believed, 
            Hinduism, led to practices of peace to humanity, and the idea that when nationalist ideas were 
            added to this peaceful belief system, a secular nation could be formed. His involvement with 
            Hindu Mahasabha leaders gathered criticism from the Naujawan Bharat Sabha as the Mahasabhas were 
            non-secular, which did not conform with the system laid out by the Indian National Congress. 
            This focus on Hindu practices in the subcontinent would ultimately lead him to the continuation 
            of peaceful movements to create successful demonstrations for Indian independence.

            In 1884, his father was transferred to Rohtak, and Rai came along after the completion of his 
            studies at Lahore. In 1886, he moved to Hisar where his father was transferred, and started to 
            practice law and became a founding member of the Bar council of Hisar along with Babu Churamani. 
            Since childhood, he also had a desire to serve his country and therefore took a pledge to free it 
            from foreign rule, in the same year he also founded the Hisar district branch of the Indian 
            National Congress and reformist Arya Samaj with Babu Churamani (lawyer), three Tayal brothers 
            (Chandu Lal Tayal, Hari Lal Tayal and Balmokand Tayal), Dr. Ramji Lal Hooda, Dr. Dhani Ram, Arya 
            Samaj Pandit Murari Lal, Seth Chhaju Ram Jat (founder of Jat School, Hisar) and Dev Raj 
            Sandhir. In 1888 and again in 1889, he had the honor of being one of the four delegates from 
            Hisar to attend the annual session of the Congress at Allahabad, along with Babu Churamani, Lala 
            Chhabil Das and Seth Gauri Shankar. In 1892, he moved to Lahore to practice before the Lahore 
            High Court. To shape the political policy of India to gain independence, he also practiced 
            journalism and was a regular contributor to several newspapers including The Tribune. In 1886, 
            he helped Mahatma Hansraj establish the nationalistic Dayananda Anglo-Vedic School, Lahore

            In 1914, he quit law practice to dedicate himself to the freedom of India and went to Britain in 
            1914 and then to the United States in 1917. In October 1917, he founded the Indian Home Rule 
            League of America in New York. He stayed in the United States from 1917 to 1920. Sometimes 
            according to Indian historians he was born into a Hindu family at Punjab. His early freedom 
            struggle was impacted by Arya Samaj and communal representation.

                Young India: An Interpretation and a History of the Nationalist Movement from Within. New 
                York: B.W. Huebsch, 1916. This book was written shortly after World War I broke out in 
                Europe. Lajpat Rai was traveling in the United States at the time of Franz Ferdinand's 
                assassination. Rai wrote the book to exclaim his people's desire to help the British, 
                who had been ruling in India since the mid-1700s, fight against the Germans. While the book 
                makes the Indian people sound good, saying that they were rushing in masses to volunteer for 
                war, one must take what Rai says with a grain of salt. Rai is trying to gain American 
                support in India against British colonialism, and the Indian people would look bad in the 
                American public's, as well as government's, eyes if they were not willing to fight for the 
                greater good, even on the side of Britain. Rai also makes the point to emphasize that the 
                Indian people do not want to engage in a military conflict with Britain. In Young India, 
                Rai makes many parallels to the American fight for independence against the British, such as 
                their common enemy (the British), their wish for self-sovereignty, and the right to bear arms 
                as an independent nation. Rai uses Young India to convey his idea of an independent India, 
                free from the viceroys and rule of the English Parliament. Rai wishes to have complete 
                sovereignty from all foreign rule, but he needs to gain the support of America, his only true 
                hope for an ally against Britain. Young India gives a first-hand account of one of the primary 
                freedom fighters in India in the early 1900s. Rai was one of the most well-known leaders of 
                the Nationalist, as well as Independence, Movement in India. By writing an account outlining 
                the history of India, showing that the Indian people are better than the stereotype given by 
                the West, willing and able to govern themselves, and attempting to gain American support 
                against the Colonial British, Rai allows his readers to understand what is actually happening 
                in India and why India should become an independent nation.

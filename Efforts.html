        <h1> The Efforts taken by Lala lajat Rai for the Indian independence :-</h1>
        <p>
            In 1928, the British government set up the Commission, headed by Sir John Simon (Later, Lord 
            Simon, 1st Viscount Simon) to report on the political situation in India. The Indian political 
            parties boycotted the Commission, because it did not include a single Indian in its membership, 
            and it met with country-wide protests. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, 
            Lajpat Rai led a non-violent march in protest against it. The protesters chanted "Simon go back" 
            and carried black flags.

            The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi (baton) charge the 
            protesters and personally assaulted Rai. Despite being extremely injured, Rai subsequently 
            addressed the crowd and said, "I declare that the blows struck at me today will be the last nails 
            in the coffin of British rule in India".
